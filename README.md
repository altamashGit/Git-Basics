1. Tracking Changes/History 
Git is very usefull while working on project and you want to track every changes that you made(e.g. , code . document. configuration)

2. Collabration
Use Git in team projects to share code and manage changes
from multiple contribution.

3. Remote Backup
Use Git to push your local project to a remote repository(e.g., GitHub,GitLab) to create a secure backup.

4. Branching for Feature Development
Git is also good while create a branches for working in new features,bug fixes , or experiments.

5. Development & Automation
One of the most demanding work CI/CD pipeline to automate development and testing .

In Use Cases
@ Software development (e.g , Coding Projects)
@ Documentation Projects (e.g , techinica; writing, tutorials)
@ Configuration Infrastructure-as-code (e.g , Terraform , Ansible)
@ Personal Projects to track progress or collabration
@ Git-Basics
