##  Starting Your Git Journey â€“ Letâ€™s Talk About Init, Add, and Commit

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project (git init)

Think of this as telling Git, "Hey, start keeping an eye on this folder."

Open your project folder in the terminal.
Run this command:

        git init

Youâ€™ll see something like this:
        Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/your/project/.git/

âœ¨ Now Git is paying attention to your project. It created a hidden .git folder to track changes behind the scenes. ðŸŽ‰

# what happend behind when you enter this command....?

When you run the git init command in a directory, it creates a new, empty Git repository within that directory by generating a hidden .git folder which stores all the necessary metadata to track changes to your files
